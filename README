General configuration files on a local machine.
1) rsync exclude list
I found myself to be rsync directory from locale machine to servers and
vice-versa. Usually excluding data files, object files and so on. I create a
file with the list of files to be excluded in general.

2) bashrc

first rename your all .bashrc to .bashrc_custom
Rename bashrc to .bashrc file and add it to home directory

3) screenrc
